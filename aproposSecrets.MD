In JavaScript, there's no built-in way to create private or secret constants. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using closures or JavaScript classes.

1. **Closures**: You can create a function that returns another function or object. The inner function or object will have access to the outer function's scope, so any variables declared in the outer function will be accessible to the inner function or object but not to the outside world.

```javascript
function secretKeeper() {
    const secretConst = "My Secret";
    return function() {
        return secretConst;
    }
}

const getSecret = secretKeeper();
console.log(getSecret()); // Outputs: My Secret
```

In this example, `secretConst` is not directly accessible from outside the `secretKeeper` function. The `getSecret` function returned by `secretKeeper` has access to `secretConst` because it's in the same scope.

2. **JavaScript Classes**: In JavaScript classes, you can use `#` to create private fields. These fields are only accessible within the class.

```javascript
class SecretKeeper {
    #secretConst;

    constructor() {
        this.#secretConst = "My Secret";
    }

    getSecret() {
        return this.#secretConst;
    }
}

const mySecretKeeper = new SecretKeeper();
console.log(mySecretKeeper.getSecret()); // Outputs: My Secret
```

In this example, `#secretConst` is a private field in the `SecretKeeper` class. It's only accessible within the class, so it's not directly accessible from outside the class. The `getSecret` method can access `#secretConst` because it's in the same class.
